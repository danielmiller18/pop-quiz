# pop-quiz

For this assignment I created a timed quiz using JavaScript. Along with writing my CSS and HTML, I wrote out the JS code and used the live server to look for errors as I went. My committed changes are a mix of updating code, debugging JS issues, and "cleaning up" my files to be better organized and formatted correctly.
